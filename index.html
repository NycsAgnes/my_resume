    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>You say <i>multi-tasking</i>? I say 'Hey, I'm a mom of 3, I truly am an <b>expert</b> of multi-tasking'! <br/>
       Other than that, I am an emerging web developer, wannabe full-stack developer, with a strong interest in app developing in the future.</p>
    <p>I love to work with infinite amount of letters and numbers, they are so nicely quiet, don't you think?</p>
